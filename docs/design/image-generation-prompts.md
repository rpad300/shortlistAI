2. ✅ Ensure correct dimensions for target use
3. ✅ Check contrast and readability (especially for text overlays)
4. ✅ Test on both light and dark backgrounds
5. ✅ Generate multiple sizes for responsive images
6. ✅ Verify brand colors match guidelines (#0066FF, #7C3AED)
7. ✅ Add proper alt text when implementing in HTML
8. ✅ Test loading performance
