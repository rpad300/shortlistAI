```

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` file based on `.env.example` (in project root)

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## PWA Features

The app is configured as a PWA with:

- **Manifest** - Defined in `vite.config.ts`
- **Service Worker** - Auto-generated by `vite-plugin-pwa`
- **Offline support** - Caches app shell and API responses
- **Install prompt** - Users can install on their device

Icons for PWA should be placed in `public/icons/`:
- `icon-192x192.png`
- `icon-512x512.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`

## Internationalization

The app supports 4 languages out of the box:
- English (EN) - Base language
- Portuguese (PT)
- French (FR)
- Spanish (ES)

Language is detected from:
1. User's saved preference (localStorage)
2. Browser language
3. Fallback to English

To add or modify translations, edit files in `src/i18n/locales/`.

## Theming

The app supports light and dark modes through CSS variables.

Variables are defined in `src/index.css`:
- Light theme (default)
- Dark theme (auto-detected or manual)

Users can toggle theme manually, and preference is saved to localStorage.

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Never hardcode user-facing strings (use i18n)
- Test responsive layouts on multiple screen sizes
- Ensure PWA requirements are met (Lighthouse score)
- Follow accessibility guidelines (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation)

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

The build:
- Minifies and bundles all code
- Generates service worker for offline support
- Splits vendor code for better caching
- Creates a production-ready PWA

## Environment Variables

Frontend environment variables are prefixed with `VITE_`:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

These are defined in the root `.env.example` file.

## API Integration

All API calls should go through the `src/services/` layer.

Example:
```typescript
import api from '@services/api';

const response = await api.post('/interviewer/step1', data);
```

The base URL is configured in `vite.config.ts` as a proxy during development, and read from environment variables in production.
